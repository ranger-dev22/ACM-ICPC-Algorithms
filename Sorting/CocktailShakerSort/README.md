# Cocktail shaker sort

[Cocktail shaker sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort), also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort
(which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort,
is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort.
The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through
the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort,
and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance
improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of
practical interest (insertion sort is preferred for simple sorts), though it finds some use in
education.
