# ACM-ICPC Algorithms

### Introduction to ACM ICPC
For starters: ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. 

For nerds: Elaborately, we can say that the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. 

### Then what is the purpose of ACM-ICPC Algorithms ?
ACM-ICPC Algorithms is your personal offline collection of every algorithm and data structure used to solve the questions of this worldwide recognized Olympiad.This provides solutions in a various languages spanning C, C++, Java, Python and others.
If you know algorithm and don't know particular language, this is effort to help you understand ICPC algorithms in favorite language.
If you have found this effort interesting and rewarding, please refer this for [contribution](https://github.com/matthewsamuel95/ACM-ICPC-Algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
