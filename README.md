# ACM-ICPC Algorithms

### Introduction to ACM ICPC
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. 

Alternately, we can say that the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. 
- Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. 
- Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on what could be done. 
- Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. 

### Then what is the purpose of ACM-ICPC Algorithms ?
ACM-ICPC Algorithms is a collection of importants algorithm and data structure used to solve questions in this worldwide olympiad. It aims to provide solutions in various languages as per [ICPC 2018 WF](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment), including:
-  C 
-  C++
-  Java
-  Python (2 & 3)
-  Kotlin.

If you know algorithms but don't know a particular language, this can help you understand ICPC algorithms in the following languages:
- C++ 
- Python
